Notes

This is a premium product, so user experience should be considered, but the main focus is well-structured, scalable, and maintainable code.
AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) are expectedâ€”use them to speed up development, but ensure the final solution is high-quality.
The time limit is 2-3 hours. You are not expected to fully complete the app.
Be prepared to discuss your approach, trade-offs, and how AI assisted you in a follow-up conversation.
